## Hinderances

- No Physical Access to Routers
- Need for of Public Documentation Reliance
- Lack of Performance Testing
- Opinion in Usability Scoring (Without real user testing or interface must rely on online feedback)
- Limited Privileges for Security Testing (Can't validate secure boot, firewall behavior, log and alert handling)
- Dynamic CVE data (data may change day to day)
- Inconsistent Cost Models Across ISPs (some routers are bundled into plans with no cost breakdown)
- No agreement on the technical knowledge that we expect from our target audience

## Ongoing Risks

| Risk name (value) | Impact | Likelihood | Description | Mitigation Strategies                                                                                                                                                         |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Licensing/paywalls (42) | 7 | 6 | Licensing and paywalls are not as much of an ongoing risk as originally predicted. The original plan of running dynamic analysis on router firmware is now out-of-scope for Milestone 2. Many router configurations are explained vaguely in White Papers. Physical access to routers would yield comprehensive deliverables for evaluating routers. Milestone 3 will elaborate how the lack of physical access to the evaluated routers will result in guesswork. | We for now want to focus on the free resources we have NIST and cablelbsa public documentatation.                                                                             |
| Network delivery performance issues (2) | 2 | 1 | Our PoC (proof of concept) has changed scope since Milestone 1. Our team opted for a website over a virtualized network environment. Network delivery and performance issues are still a relevant risk; just applied differently. A website can experience performance problems stemming from remote attacks. If our website has an unmanaged field or form, then a DoS attack could bring down the website. Although the website is public-facing, the chances of an attack within the timeline of this semester is unlikely. | We have a lightweight version of the backup if the performance makes an issue. Azure provides an extra layer of security and options we are yet to discover and work further. |
| Missed deadline (12) | 6 | 2 | Deadlines might be missed. However, each team member has shown outstanding initiative. Dedication to the project is in no short supply. | We had a good backup when teammates aren't available and we plan to have schedules mentioned in the group at least 3 days in advance.                                         |
| Firmware EULAs (0) | 0 | 0 | This risk is deprecated. Firmware decompiling is out-of-scope for the rest of the project. | N/A |                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Low user satisfaction (18) | 3 | 6 | This is the only risk that grew in liklihood since Milestone 1. Now that the technical deliverable is solely scoped to the website, it carries extra expectations on its user satisfaction. One of the listed hinderances is having no clear target audience for this website. What level of technical experience do we reasonably expect a user to have when they harden their router? This question burns a hole in our literature review. | We intend to make a feedback mechanism not too much dynamic but a basic email version that sends a notification when received a comment.                                      |
