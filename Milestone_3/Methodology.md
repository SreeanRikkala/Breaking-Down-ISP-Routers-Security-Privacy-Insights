# Project Methodology: ISP Router Evaluation

## Project Overview
This project evaluates ISP provided and compatible third party consumer routers using a quantifiable grid across our four categories: Security, Usability, Performance, and Cost.

## Objectives
- Identify metrics based on best practices and industry standards.
- Create a scoring matrix to evaluate routers.
- Present results so consumers can understand their router's strengths and weaknesses.

## Research Standards & Sources
Our methodology is based in the following:
- NIST IR 8425A – Cybersecurity Requirements for Consumer-Grade Routers
- CableLabs Gateway Device Security Best Common Practices (CL-GL-GDS-BCP-V01-211007)
- RFC 2544 – Network Performance Testing
- Ookla Speedtest Reports – Crowdsourced performance benchmarks
- SmallNetBuilder, CNET, Reddit, and manufacturer documentation
- BSI TR-03148 Secure Broadband Router 
- TR-124: Functional Requirements for Broadband Residential Gateway Devices
- NIST SP 800-128 – Security-Focused Configuration Management
- System Usability Scale (SUS)
- Heuristic Evaluation (Nielsen)

## Evaluation Framework
We score four categories:

| Category     | Weight |
|--------------|--------|
| Security     | 50%    |
| Usability    | 17%    |
| Performance  | 25%    |
| Cost         | 8%     |

## Weighting Justification
Security was based on its role in the necessity for protecting data. Performance and usability have impact  on user satisfaction and cost is included as it is an important piece for some users.

## Data Sources
Due to the lack of physical access to devices all scoring is based on:
- ISP and manufacturer documentation
- Publicly available vulnerability databases 
- Third party reviews
- User reported performance from forums

## Limitations
- Certain security features could not be verified due to lack of access
- Some metrics were estimated using third party reports
