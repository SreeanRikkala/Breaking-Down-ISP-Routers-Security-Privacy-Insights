Consumer networking devices are expanding at an accelerating rate, introducing more routers, modems, IoT devices, and other smart home devices into the typical consumers’ home network. These devices often rely on consumers’ knowledge to apply the proper security configuration for a strong network. Relying on consumers’ knowledge can lead to poor data governance, privacy concerns, vulnerabilities, and insecure networks. It is imperative that the best practices for data governance are in place to protect users’ data and keep their networks private.

This research will look to see how best practices for data governance can be automated during the onboarding process of the devices as well as explore a way to make the process seamless to prevent user misconfiguration and minimize the reliance on the user’s knowledge. The objectives are as follows:
- **Reduce User Dependency** 
	-Minimize the reliance on the user's knowledge for applying proper security settings to consumer networking devices.
- **Increase Network Security** 
	- Automate security configurations to enforce the strongest network security
- **Protect Users Privacy**
	- Automate privacy settings to ensure data is private
- **Standardize Best Practices** 
	- Create a standard best practice for data governance for networking devices out-of-the-box to consistency between all networking devices.

The proposed approach would require reviewing a consumer’s networking device and researching a way to make it more secure such as allowing automatic firmware updates, setting configuration of the network device to be the most secure settings, requiring default credentials to be changed, and strong password enforcement, more user friendly GUI.

The expected result of this research would significantly lessen the stress and end user experiences when they must set up a new networking device as well as grant them peace of mind that the device they set up is secure, and their network is private. This research could help to change the way consumer networking devices handle data governance and potentially make good data governance out of the box a new standard for networking devices.
