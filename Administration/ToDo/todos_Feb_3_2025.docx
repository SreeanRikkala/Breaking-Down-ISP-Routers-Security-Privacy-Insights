To do -
Schedule meeting times with team
Come up with ideas for milestone one, possible work on mapping out the phases of the projet
These are just my thoughts - What is the scope, how are we going to achieve it, what are the research questions we can ask, what are optional routes if it doesn't work out, research tools to use for vuln scanning/pen testing of network devices, research open source firmware editors (GNU Debugger), research most exploitable network device?, common network device vulns as starting point or most used network consumer device, wifi mesh routers, consumer cost for insecure network devices, supplier cost (loss/rep) for insecure network devices, what is end goal. Start -> research question (are network devices inherintely insecure) -> research that question -> pick device to prod -> research tools to use -> start using tools and documenting results -> find potential issue -> research issue -> repeat
What devices do we need from Dr. Hale
Divide labor, assign responsibilities
Someone needs to be the group leader and keep people on track/milestones on track, I don't know enough about this to feel like i'm a good fit I vote corey lol
