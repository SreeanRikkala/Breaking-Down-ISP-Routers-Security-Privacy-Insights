### Hale Requirements:
**Technical Plan**
Once you have examined the relevant literature, you should prepare a technical plan that outlines and defines your methodology. 
Important consideration should be made to ensure that your methodology uses the literature to the best extent possible. 
Your technical plan should provide a detailed description of exactly what and how you will do what you plan to do.

Any data collection, testing/development methods, architectures, and data analysis techniques that you wish to use should all be included in your technical plan.

- Coverage	
  - The technical plan overviews all of the areas required to be successful in the project.
- Depth
  - The technical plan contains sufficient detail to understand and define exactly what will be done in the project.
- Soundness
  - The technical plan is rooted in scientific method and the plan is well designed.
- Scope
  - The technical plan is properly scoped for the duration of the class.

### Actual Technical Plan
**Briefest of Summaries to Build Off**
<br>
The research deliverable will identify potential gaps in the consumer networking equipment lifecycle. 
Taking the results of this research as it develops will allow us to create a standard with procedures for securing a certain model of consumer networking equipment. 
The procedures identified will be model specific, but the standard will apply to similar networking devices. The developed procedure will be used to simulate 
a networking environment virtually which demonstrates the mitigation of identified security gaps. Additional tests and procedures can be developed to fit the 
scope of the semester. For example, additional tests could examine hardware data security, trial a real environment, or display examples of attacks
being used against insecure equipment.
