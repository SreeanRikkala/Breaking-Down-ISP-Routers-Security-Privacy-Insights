# Project Methodology: ISP Router Evaluation

## Project Overview
This project evaluates ISP provided and compatible third party consumer routers using a quantifiable scoring framework across four core categories: Security, Usability, Performance, and Cost.

## Objectives
- Identify evaluation criteria based on best practices and industry standards.
- Create a scoring matrix to evaluate routers consistently.
- Present results in a way that empowers consumers to understand their router's strengths and weaknesses.

## Research Standards & Sources
Our methodology is grounded in the following:
- NIST IR 8425A – Cybersecurity Requirements for Consumer-Grade Routers
- CableLabs Gateway Device Security Best Common Practices (CL-GL-GDS-BCP-V01-211007)
- RFC 2544 – Network Performance Testing
- Ookla Speedtest Reports – Crowdsourced performance benchmarks
- SmallNetBuilder, CNET, Reddit, and manufacturer documentation
- BSI TR-03148 Secure Broadband Router 
- TR-124: Functional Requirements for Broadband Residential Gateway Devices
- NIST SP 800-128 – Security-Focused Configuration Management
- System Usability Scale (SUS)
- Heuristic Evaluation (Nielsen)

## Evaluation Framework
We score four categories:

| Category     | Weight |
|--------------|--------|
| Security     | 50%    |
| Usability    | 17%    |
| Performance  | 25%    |
| Cost         | 8%     |

## Weighting Justification
Security was prioritized due to its critical role in protecting data. Performance and usability were included based on their impact on satisfaction, while cost is included with lower weight to reflect value.

## Data Sources
Because of the lack of physical access to devices, all scoring is based on:
- Official ISP and manufacturer documentation
- Public vulnerability databases 
- Third-party benchmark reviews
- User reported performance from forums

## Limitations
- Certain internal security features could not be verified (e.g., secure boot)
- Performance metrics were estimated using third-party reports
- Subjective usability feedback was standardized using established heuristics
